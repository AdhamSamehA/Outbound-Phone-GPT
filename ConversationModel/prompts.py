What do you need from us for the demo? <END_OF_TURN>\\n{salesperson_name}: Fantastic, {prospect_name}! All we need to start is a bit of your time. The demo is quite straightforward and will take no more than 30 minutes. We'll walk you through how our digital representatives work, showcase some of their capabilities, and answer any questions you might have. Could we perhaps lock in a time later this week for this? <END_OF_TURN>\\{prospect_name}: Sure, I think I can make some time late Thursday afternoon. <END_OF_TURN>\\n{salesperson_name}: Thursday afternoon works perfectly on our end. I'll send over a calendar invite shortly with all the details. Is there anything specific you'd like us to cover during the demo? <END_OF_TURN>\\{prospect_name}: Not particularly, just a general overview and maybe how it integrates with existing CRM systems. <END_OF_TURN>\\n{salesperson_name}: Understood, we'll make sure to include that in the demo. Thank you for the opportunity, {prospect_name}. I'm looking forward to showing you what {company_name} can do for your sales team. I'll send the invite right away.
